ggplotTicks

Provides a single* function mirror.ticks that puts scale ticks on all four sides on a ggplot by copying axes from bottom to top and left to right. Think of this as a replacement for the panel grid; it is not a way of adding multiple scales to the same plot.

Note that mirroring converts the plot from a ggplot object to a gtable, so build the whole plot first and then call mirror.ticks as the last transformation before plotting.

*Plus a helper function or two, but these may or may not ever be useful outside of mirror.ticks.

Installation:
  
  From R using devtools (recommended)

install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
install_github("infotroph/ggplotTicks")
Note that I think you can ignore the step of the devtools installation instructions where it claims you need a full development toolchain (on OS X this involves a multi-gigabyte download of Xcode). If you have any trouble installing on a machine with no developer tools, please let me know.

From a command line

Modify this as needed for your system. Probably only necessary if you want to edit the package code.

git clone https://github.com/infotroph/ggplotTicks.git
R CMD build ggplotTicks
R CMD install ggplotTicks_<version.number.here>.tar.gz
Once installed, load and use it like any other package: library(ggplotTicks); myplot = ggplot(...); mirror.ticks(myplot)
